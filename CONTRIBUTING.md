## How to Contribute

### Adding New Timeline Entries

The easiest way to contribute is by adding new historical locations and events:

1. **Fork the repository** and create a new branch for your contribution

2. **Create a new Markdown file** in `src/content/timeline/`
   - Use the naming convention: `YYYY-descriptive-title.md`
   - Example: `1920-craftsman-house-walnut-ave.md`

3. **Use the template** from `src/content/timeline/_TEMPLATE.md`:

```markdown
---

sources:
  - title: "Source name"
    url: "https://example.com (optional)"
  - title: "Another source"
tags: ["tag1", "tag2"] # Optional for future filtering

## Content Guidelines

### Historical Accuracy

- **Cite your sources**: Always include source information
- **Verify dates**: Cross-reference multiple sources when possible
- **Be specific**: Include exact addresses when known
- **Neutral tone**: Present facts objectively

### Writing Style

- **Concise descriptions**: Keep frontmatter descriptions to 1-2 sentences
- **Detailed content**: Add rich historical context in the markdown body
- **Active voice**: Make the writing engaging and accessible
- **Proper attribution**: Credit photographers, architects, and researchers

### Architectural Styles

Use consistent terminology for architectural styles. Common styles in Santa Cruz include:

- Victorian (specify: Italianate, Queen Anne, Eastlake, etc.)
- Craftsman Bungalow
- Spanish Colonial Revival
- Mission Revival
- Art Deco / Moderne
- Mid-Century Modern
- Contemporary / Sustainable

If unsure, use general terms or mark as "N/A" with a note in the content.

## Code Style

### TypeScript

- Enable strict mode (already configured)
- Avoid `any` types
- Prefer interfaces for object shapes
- Use const for immutable values

### Astro Components

- Keep components focused and single-purpose
- Use props for configuration
- Extract reusable logic to utilities
- Document complex components

### CSS/Tailwind

- Use Tailwind utility classes when possible
- Extract repeated patterns to components
- Maintain the branded color scheme: `rgb(226, 111, 4)`
- Ensure mobile responsiveness

## Testing

All code contributions should include tests:

```bash
# Run tests in watch mode
npm test

# Run tests once
npm run test:run

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Open UI
npm run test:ui
```

## File Naming Conventions

### Timeline Entries
- Format: `YYYY-descriptive-slug.md`
- Examples:
  - `1877-mccormick-house.md`
  - `1976-town-clock-santa-cruz.md`
- Use lowercase with hyphens
- Start with 4-digit year

### Components
