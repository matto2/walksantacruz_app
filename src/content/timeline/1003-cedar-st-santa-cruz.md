## Overview

The **Santa Cruz Hotel**, located at 1003 Cedar Street, was built in **1877** and designed by **Charles Kaye**. The building is listed on the **City of Santa Cruz Historic Building Survey (Volume II, Page 13)** and remains one of the city's enduring historic commercial structures.

## Architectural History

Originally constructed in a **Late Victorian Commercial / Italianate** style, the Santa Cruz Hotel reflected the architectural trends of the late 19th century with ornamental woodwork, tall narrow windows, and bracketed cornices typical of the era.

In the **late 1930s**, the building underwent a major remodel of its **ground floor**, which introduced **Streamline Moderne** design elements — a popular style of the Art Deco period characterized by curved corners, horizontal lines, and smooth surfaces. This redesign is commonly attributed to local architect **C. E. Butner**. The updated façade was in place by **1971**, as documented in UCSC library archives.

## Later Uses

Over the decades, the Santa Cruz Hotel hosted a range of businesses and establishments on its first floor, including the hotel dining room and bar, later the **Santa Cruz Hotel Bar & Grille**, **Planet Fresh Burritos**, and the **Red Restaurant & Bar (Redroom)**.

Today, the building stands as a **designated historic resource** that showcases the layering of architectural eras — from Victorian origins to Depression-era Streamline modernism — in downtown Santa Cruz’s evolving streetscape.
