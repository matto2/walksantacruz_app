## Origins: A Home for Music and Art

Built in **1921** by **Salvator and Frances Bagnell Fachutar**, 303 Walnut Avenue began life as both a family home and a professional music studio. The Fachutars were passionate musicians who transformed the property into what was soon known as **the largest music house between San Francisco and Los Angeles**.

To help sustain their artistic pursuits, the couple also produced **perfume on the property**, an unusual but creative means of supporting their musical ambitions. The scent of their enterprise — quite literally — mingled with the sounds of piano and voice lessons drifting through downtown Santa Cruz.

## A New Chapter: The YWCA Years

In **1944**, Frances Fachutar sold the house to the **Santa Cruz YWCA**, marking a new era of community service and inclusion. Under the leadership of **Mrs. Fred McPherson**, **Edith Hinds**, **Mabel Byrne**, and **Bertha Adams**, the YWCA became a pioneering organization dedicated to **women’s empowerment, racial inclusion, and youth programming**.

The building became affectionately known as **“Club 303”**, hosting one of the city’s first **teen nightclubs**, and later launched the **Gay Troubadours**, the first all-boys club sponsored by a YWCA. These programs broke social barriers, providing safe, welcoming spaces for young people and women of all backgrounds during a period of significant social change.

## Legacy and Continuity

Today, the property continues to serve the community as the **Walnut Avenue Family & Women’s Center**, providing support, education, and advocacy for women and families across Santa Cruz County. Nearly a century after its construction, the building’s walls still resonate with the same purpose they were built for — to nurture creativity, compassion, and community connection.
