## A Step Back in Time

Nestled on Green Street near Mission Hill, this humble **concrete mounting block**, dated to around **1864**, offers one of the few surviving public‑street relics of Santa Cruz’s horse‑and‑carriage era.

Back then, riders and passengers needed a sturdy step up into wagons and buggies. The block sat beside **hitching rails**, serving as the pedestrian counterpart to the horse’s tie‑up. Its worn corners and weathered surface still echo the click of boot‑heels and the creak of wooden wheels.

## Surviving the Shift to Cars

As the automobile surged forward in the early 20th century, many mounting blocks and hitching posts were removed or covered up. The one at **123 Green Street**, constructed of concrete rather than stone, stands out — believed to be the **last surviving mounting block in town**.

Walking past it now, you’re stepping into a moment when downtown streets were filled with hoof‑beats and dust, not engine roars or exhaust fumes. One marble of the past, still quietly rooted in place.
