## The Church Years (1850-1863)

The unassuming house at 123 Green Street conceals a remarkable architectural journey. What appears today as a handsome Italianate residence with Colonial Revival flourishes began life as something far humbler: a 20×30-foot wooden box.

Erected in summer 1850 at the southeast corner of Mission and Green Streets, this modest structure was Santa Cruz's first Protestant church building—the original Methodist-Episcopal Church. William Taylor of San Francisco dedicated it in December 1850 as the first appointed pastor, though he had a large circuit and relied on rotating substitutes from the congregation, including Elihu Anthony, Adna Hecox, H.S. Loveland, A. McLean, and Enos Baumont. The pews contained built-in desks so the building could serve as a schoolroom during the week—practical frontier multitasking at its finest.

## The Move (1863-1864)

By the early 1860s, the growing congregation had outgrown the little box. A new, larger church was built in 1863 on the same Mission & Green corner. The original building was moved down Green Street to its present location, where carpenter William Woolsey Reynolds, who had arrived in Santa Cruz in 1856 and become one of the town's first builders, purchased and converted it to his residence around 1864.

## The Architectural Makeover (1885 and later)

The house you see today bears little resemblance to that plain 1850 meetinghouse. Around 1885, druggist J.J. Hug bought the property and doubled its size, adding the front porch and bay windows that give it Italianate character. Later owner T.W. Kelly contributed Colonial Revival touches, including the distinctive Palladian window.

## Victorian Conveniences (1880s-1890s)

The concrete carriage mounting block at the curb captures another layer of this transformation. Likely installed during the 1880s-1890s when Hug was enlarging the house, it reflects concrete's booming popularity as the modern building material of the era. While earlier mounting blocks were laboriously carved from stone, the new concrete plants—including Davenport's operation up the coast—made it possible to cast durable, utilitarian fixtures on demand. Santa Cruz was being rebuilt in concrete: sidewalks, foundations, curbs, and yes, mounting blocks for an increasingly prosperous middle class climbing into their carriages.

## Reading the Architecture

The City of Santa Cruz describes it as "a square-fronted, two-story Italianate style house with a low-hipped roof"—and those details tell the Victorian transformation story:

- **Low-hipped roof**: The signature of Italianate design, where roofs slope gently on all sides and sit low against the sky
- **Bay windows**: The projecting bays were part of Hug's 1885 expansion, adding both Victorian grandeur and interior light
- **Front porch**: Another 1885 addition, likely with decorative brackets supporting the eaves (typical Italianate flourish)
- **Palladian window**: Kelly's later Colonial Revival nod, blending architectural eras

The building's evolution from austere frontier church to layered Victorian residence mirrors Mission Hill's own transformation from raw settlement to established neighborhood—all visible in one well-traveled structure.

> ### The Carriage Block
>
> **A Step Back in Time**
>
> Nestled on Green Street near Mission Hill, this humble concrete mounting block, dated to around 1864, offers one of the few surviving public street relics of Santa Cruz's horse-and-carriage era.
>
> Back then, riders and passengers needed a sturdy step up into wagons and buggies. The block sat beside hitching rails, serving as the pedestrian counterpart to the horse's tie-up. Its worn corners and weathered surface still echo the click of boot-heels and the creak of wooden wheels.
>
> **Surviving the Shift to Cars**
>
> As the automobile surged forward in the early 20th century, many mounting blocks and hitching posts were removed or covered up. The one at 123 Green Street, constructed of concrete rather than stone, stands out — believed to be the last surviving mounting block in town.
>
> Walking past it now, you're stepping into a moment when downtown streets were filled with hoof-beats and dust, not engine roars or exhaust fumes. One marble of the past, still quietly rooted in place.
