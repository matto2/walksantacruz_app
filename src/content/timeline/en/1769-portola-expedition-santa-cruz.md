## Overview

The **Portolá Expedition campsite** marks the **first recorded European visit** to the area now known as Santa Cruz. On **October 17, 1769**, Spanish explorer **Gaspar de Portolá** and his party crossed the **San Lorenzo River**, likely near where the **Soquel Avenue bridge** stands today, as they made their way north in search of the _“port of Monterey”_ described by **Sebastián Vizcaíno** more than 160 years earlier.

Their previous campsite lay in the **Salinas Valley**, near today’s **Marina**, where they believed they had reached Vizcaíno’s famed harbor. But after surveying the coastline, the expedition failed to recognize **Monterey Bay** as the same site described in earlier maps. Mistaking it for an unfamiliar stretch of coast, Portolá’s group moved on — continuing north rather than staying to claim the area as intended.

Traveling inland and following the natural contours of the coastal plain, the expedition eventually emerged near **present-day Santa Cruz**, where they made camp and crossed the San Lorenzo River. The party’s chaplain, **Franciscan missionary Juan Crespí**, kept a detailed diary and recorded:

> “This river was named _San Lorenzo_.”

The next morning, after breaking camp, Crespí noted:

> “Five hundred steps after we started we crossed a good arroyo of running water which descends from some high hills where it rises. It was named _El Arroyo de la Santísima Cruz_ — ‘The Stream of the Most Holy Cross.’”

This brief entry gave the future city of **Santa Cruz** its name.

## Location and Interpretation

While Crespí’s diaries allow historians to identify the general area, the **exact location of the crossing and campsite remains unknown**. Shifting river channels and later urban development make it impossible to pinpoint with certainty.

Some local historians and interpreters have suggested that the expedition may have **angled toward Santa Cruz** because the area appeared **more sheltered from coastal winds** than the open dunes near Moss Landing.  
However, **no primary source explicitly confirms this**, and the idea should be regarded as **informed interpretation rather than documented fact**.

## Significance

The Portolá Expedition’s brief stay near the San Lorenzo River represents the **beginning of recorded European contact** in Santa Cruz County.  
Their naming of both the **San Lorenzo River** and **Arroyo de la Santísima Cruz** marks the origin of two enduring local place names — and laid the groundwork for the later **Spanish mission system**, including the founding of **Mission Santa Cruz** in 1791.
