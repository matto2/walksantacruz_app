## Location Names

This historic intersection goes by many names, each reflecting a different era:
- **The Lower Plaza** (junction of Pacific, Front, Mission & Water Streets - laid out 1848)
- **Town Clock Plaza**
- **Compass Rose Area** (features compass rose by artist Sean Monaghan pointing to Santa Cruz's sister cities)

All names point to the same truth: this is where downtown Santa Cruz began.

## Original Mission Site (1791-1793)

**August 28, 1791**: Mission Santa Cruz was founded near the intersection of River Street and North Pacific Avenue, at the bottom of Mission Hill. This makes the Lower Plaza area the **birthplace of European settlement** in Santa Cruz.

The location proved disastrous. When winter rains came, the San Lorenzo River overflowed and **flooded the mission in its first winter**. In 1793, the padres relocated to higher ground atop Mission Hill—but this riverside flat remained the natural gateway between the mission and the beach, destined to become commercial heart of the future town.

## Elihu Anthony's Foundry & Business Empire (1848-1870s)

### The First Downtown Business (1848)

**1848**: Elihu Anthony built the **first downtown business** at this location, where the clock tower now stands. His compound included:
- Blacksmith shop
- General store
- Foundry (the **third foundry on the Pacific Coast**, after two in San Francisco)
- Post office

Anthony's foundry manufactured the **first cast-iron plows in California**, supplying the agricultural boom transforming the region.

### Naming Main Street

When Anthony subdivided his land, he named the street facing The Lower Plaza **"Main Street"**—now Front Street. This was the commercial spine of the new town, and Anthony controlled the prime corner.

### Post Office & Telegraph (1850-1861)

**April 9, 1850**: The **first U.S. Post Office in the county** opened at Anthony's Store. Mail arrived by horseback from San Jose, transforming Santa Cruz from isolated outpost to connected community.

**1861**: The Pacific Telegraph Company set up the **county's first telegraph service** at Anthony's Store, linking Santa Cruz to San Francisco and the wider world in real-time.

### The Grand Italianate Building (1870)

**1870**: Anthony tore down his 1848 pioneer store and built a **grand two-story Italianate building** featuring:
- Cast-iron goods store (ground floor)
- Public hall and auction house (upstairs)

This architectural upgrade announced that Santa Cruz had graduated from frontier town to established city.

**1851**: F.A. Hihn started a **grocery business with Henry Hentsch** at the Lower Plaza (Flatiron Building site)

**1853**: F.A. Hihn opened a **lumber yard behind the flatiron store**, supplying the building boom

## Town Clock History (1873-Present)

> **Important Note:** The clock tower did not arrive at the Lower Plaza until 1976. For over a century, it stood elsewhere on Pacific Avenue, making it a beloved downtown landmark before being relocated to its current home.

### The Original Location: Pacific Avenue (1873-1964)

**Late 1800s**: The **Odd Fellows (IOOF) Lodge** was built on **Pacific Avenue between Cooper and Church Streets**, near the courthouse—in the heart of downtown, but several blocks from the Lower Plaza.

The Odd Fellows is a men's social organization similar to the Elks or Masons, and their lodge building became a prominent downtown landmark.

**1873**: A clock tower was added as an ornament to the Odd Fellows Lodge, creating Santa Cruz's first public town clock. The tower crowned the building above Pacific Avenue, visible throughout downtown.

**1894**: The clock tower **survived the great fire** that devastated much of downtown.

**1896**: As a prominent downtown landmark, the clock tower was chosen as the site of Santa Cruz's **first public electric lighting installation**—600 incandescent lights that transformed nighttime downtown and announced the arrival of the modern age.

**1899**: The devastating fire finally caught up—the IOOF building burned, but was **rebuilt with a new clock tower**.

**1900**: The current clockworks were installed, dated **January 22, 1900**—the mechanical heart still beating today.

### The Silent Years (1929-1964)

**1929**: The bell chimes were **shut off due to hotel manager complaints**—a rare defeat for civic tradition over commerce.

**1964**: During building modernization on Pacific Avenue, the clock and tower were **removed from the Odd Fellows building and sold to the city for $1.01**. Someone saw its historical value, even if they didn't know what to do with it yet.

### Storage & Relocation to Lower Plaza (1970s-1976)

**1970s**: The clock mechanism and tower **languished in storage for a decade**, seemingly forgotten—a beloved landmark in limbo.

**1976**: America's **Bicentennial** awakened civic pride. The city decided to give the clock a new home at **the Lower Plaza (Front & Pacific)**, building a new brick tower to house the historic mechanism.

The new tower was **erected at the Lower Plaza's current location**—placed directly over the **1967 Morris Memorial Fountain**, uniting two memorials. Neighbors and organizations bought **blue bricks** to fund construction—their names still embedded in the plaza at your feet.

This was the clock's **first time at the Lower Plaza**. For over a century it had watched over Pacific Avenue blocks away; now it would anchor a different historic intersection.

**July 4, 1976**: The Town Clock was **dedicated at its new Lower Plaza location**, returning its familiar chimes to downtown Santa Cruz in a new home.

### Modern Civic Landmark (1977-Present)

**1977**: The **first demonstration at the Town Clock** (B-1 bomber protest) established it as Santa Cruz's premier gathering place for civic expression.

**October 23, 1979**: Designated **City of Santa Cruz Landmark**

**October 17, 1989, 5:04 PM**: The clock **stopped during the Loma Prieta earthquake**, marking the exact moment disaster struck—a visual memorial frozen in time.

**Early 1990s**: A plaque was added **honoring Santa Cruz lives lost in the 1989 earthquake**, deepening the site's memorial role.

**1995**: The peace sculpture **"Collateral Damage: A Reality of War"** was installed nearby, making the plaza a place to remember, reflect, and speak out.

**Present**: The Town Clock remains the **gathering place for protests, celebrations, farmers' markets, and mourning**—the town square Santa Cruz never formally planned but organically created.
