## Original Mission Site (1791-1793)

**August 28, 1791**: Mission Santa Cruz was founded near the intersection of River Street and North Pacific Avenue, at the bottom of Mission Hill. This makes the Lower Plaza area the **birthplace of European settlement** in Santa Cruz.

The location proved disastrous. When winter rains came, the San Lorenzo River overflowed and **flooded the mission in its first winter**. In 1793, the padres relocated to higher ground atop Mission Hill—but this riverside flat remained the natural gateway between the mission and the beach, destined to become commercial heart of the future town.

## Elihu Anthony's Foundry & Business Empire (1848-1870s)

### The First Downtown Business (1848)

**1848**: Elihu Anthony built the **first downtown business** at this location, where the clock tower now stands. His compound included:
- Blacksmith shop
- General store
- Foundry (the **third foundry on the Pacific Coast**, after two in San Francisco)
- Post office

Anthony's foundry manufactured the **first cast-iron plows in California**, supplying the agricultural boom transforming the region.

### Naming Main Street

When Anthony subdivided his land, he named the street facing The Lower Plaza **"Main Street"**—now Front Street. This was the commercial spine of the new town, and Anthony controlled the prime corner.

### Post Office & Telegraph (1850-1861)

**April 9, 1850**: The **first U.S. Post Office in the county** opened at Anthony's Store. Mail arrived by horseback from San Jose, transforming Santa Cruz from isolated outpost to connected community.

**1861**: The Pacific Telegraph Company set up the **county's first telegraph service** at Anthony's Store, linking Santa Cruz to San Francisco and the wider world in real-time.

### The Grand Italianate Building (1870)

**1870**: Anthony tore down his 1848 pioneer store and built a **grand two-story Italianate building** featuring:
- Cast-iron goods store (ground floor)
- Public hall and auction house (upstairs)

This architectural upgrade announced that Santa Cruz had graduated from frontier town to established city.

## Town Clock History (1873-Present)

### The First Clock (1873-1899)

**1873**: The first town clock was built as part of the **Odd Fellows (IOOF) building on Pacific Avenue** (near Church Street), becoming a beloved civic fixture.

**1894**: The first clock **survived the great fire** that devastated much of downtown.

**1900**: Current clockworks dated **January 22, 1900**—the mechanical heart still beating today.

### The Silent Years (1929-1964)

**1929**: The bell chimes were **shut off due to hotel manager complaints**—a rare defeat for civic tradition over commerce.

**1964**: During building modernization, the clock was **removed and sold to the city for $1.01**. Someone saw its historical value, even if they didn't know what to do with it yet.

### Storage & Resurrection (1970s-1976)

**1970s**: The clock mechanism **languished in storage for a decade**, seemingly forgotten.

**1976**: America's **Bicentennial** awakened civic pride. The clock was **restored and erected at the current location** as a Bicentennial project—placed directly over the **1967 Morris Memorial Fountain**, uniting two memorials.

Neighbors and organizations bought **blue bricks** to fund the tower—their names still embedded in the plaza at your feet.

**July 4, 1976**: The Town Clock was **dedicated at its new location**, returning its familiar chimes to downtown Santa Cruz.

### Modern Civic Landmark (1977-Present)

**1977**: The **first demonstration at the Town Clock** (B-1 bomber protest) established it as Santa Cruz's premier gathering place for civic expression.

**October 23, 1979**: Designated **City of Santa Cruz Landmark**

**Early 1990s**: A plaque was added **honoring Santa Cruz lives lost in the 1989 earthquake**, deepening the site's memorial role.

**1995**: The peace sculpture **"Collateral Damage: A Reality of War"** was installed nearby, making the plaza a place to remember, reflect, and speak out.

**Present**: The Town Clock remains the **gathering place for protests, celebrations, farmers' markets, and mourning**—the town square Santa Cruz never formally planned but organically created.
