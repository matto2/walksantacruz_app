## A Passage Beneath the Hill

When the Santa Cruz & Felton Railroad laid its tracks in 1875, the company's original plan called for running straight down Pacific Avenue to the Railroad Wharf, carrying redwood lumber, lime, leather, powder, and other freight to waiting ships bound for San Francisco and beyond. But city leaders, protective of Pacific Avenue's role as the main downtown retail and pedestrian corridor, passed an ordinance prohibiting the noisy, smoky steam locomotives from traveling through the heart of the growing downtown.

The solution was bold: bore a tunnel straight through Mission Hill, directly beneath the old Mission Santa Cruz complex, bypassing downtown entirely. Construction began in January 1876. By October 2, crews had broken through the 918-foot bore, and on October 10, 1876, the first train rolled through to the beach and wharf.

Over the years, rail workers claimed that bones occasionally fell through the tunnel ceiling, shaken loose by passing trains—a rumor fueled by the knowledge that the tunnel really does run beneath the old mission burial ground.

## From Steam to Today

Between 1904 and 1909, the tunnel was widened for standard-gauge trains, its portals rebuilt and squared off in concrete, and the tunnel lengthened to 927 feet. It remained an essential route for freight and later for the beloved "Beach Train" excursions that still rumble through today.
