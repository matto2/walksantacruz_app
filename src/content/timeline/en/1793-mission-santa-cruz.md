## Overview

The **Santa Cruz Mission**, officially known as _La Misión de la Exaltación de la Santa Cruz_, was founded on **August 28, 1791**. It was the **twelfth** of the **twenty-one Spanish missions** in Alta California.

The first mission structure was built in **1791** on the floodplain near the San Lorenzo River, chosen for its fertile valley and proximity to water. However, that winter a devastating **flood wiped out the original mission**, forcing the Franciscan fathers to rebuild on higher ground.

The mission was **relocated to Mission Hill** and a more substantial adobe church was completed in **1793**. This elevated site protected it from future flooding and offered commanding views of the valley below.

The mission's adobe construction used local clay mixed with straw and water, molded into bricks and dried in the sun. Thick adobe walls kept the interior cool in summer and warm in winter—an ideal adaptation for the coastal climate.

## Architecture and Layout

The original mission complex included a church, living quarters, workshops, storerooms, and agricultural buildings surrounding a central courtyard. Roofs were covered with red clay tiles made on-site, and timber beams were cut from nearby redwood forests.

A **smaller replica chapel**, built in **1931**, stands today on **Mission Hill** near the original site. It was constructed using traditional adobe methods to honor the original craftsmanship.

## Hardship and Destruction

The Santa Cruz Mission suffered more than most others in the chain:

- In **1818**, a fire destroyed much of the mission.
- The **1812 and 1857 earthquakes** caused severe structural damage.
- Flooding from the nearby San Lorenzo River repeatedly washed away fields and buildings.
- Conflicts and disease devastated the local **Awaswas-speaking Ohlone people**, whose labor sustained the mission.

By the mid-1800s, the mission lay mostly in ruins, its adobes crumbling back into the earth.

## Legacy and Preservation

The present-day **Santa Cruz Mission State Historic Park** preserves the only remaining mission building in the Monterey Bay area. It houses exhibits about mission life, the local Ohlone people, and early Spanish colonization. From the courtyard, visitors can enjoy sweeping views over downtown Santa Cruz and Monterey Bay.

The site remains an evocative symbol of California’s layered history—blending faith, colonial ambition, indigenous resilience, and architectural ingenuity in adobe.
