## Replacing the Family's Wooden Buildings

The **Patrick Neary Building** at 1362 Pacific Avenue stands as one of downtown Santa Cruz's oldest surviving commercial structures. Constructed in **1906**, the building replaced earlier wooden structures on the site that were owned by the **Neary family** — including a restaurant — which had been knocked out of alignment and damaged in the **1906 San Francisco earthquake**.

Rather than repair the damaged wood-frame buildings, **Patrick Neary** commissioned a permanent replacement in stone. An Irish immigrant whose family had arrived in Santa Cruz in the 1860s, Neary had become a significant local landowner, and he envisioned a modern commercial block built to last, one that would anchor this section of Pacific Avenue for generations to come.

## Richardsonian Romanesque Architecture

The building was designed by architect **Edward Van Cleeck** in the **Richardsonian Romanesque** style, a robust architectural language popularized in the late 19th century and characterized by heavy masonry, rounded arches, and commanding street presence.

The building's **stone façade** features **paired arched second-story windows separated by columns with Corinthian capitals** — a classical detail that adds elegance to the structure's solid form. At street level, **iron columns** frame the ground-floor storefronts, combining strength with the flexibility needed for commercial spaces that would change tenants over the decades.

## Part of Downtown's Historic Fabric

The Patrick Neary Building was recognized as a **contributing structure** in the **Pacific Avenue Historic District**, a designation that celebrated the avenue's concentration of late-19th and early-20th-century commercial architecture. This district represented the heyday of downtown Santa Cruz as a thriving commercial and social center.

The **Museum of Art & History** and the city's **blue plaque program** honor the building as a historic landmark. A blue plaque mounted on the facade reads:

> **"1906 – Patrick Neary Building – Edward Van Cleeck, Architect – Richardsonian Romanesque."**

## Surviving the 1989 Earthquake

While many neighboring downtown buildings were damaged beyond repair or demolished following the **1989 Loma Prieta earthquake**, the Patrick Neary Building's solid stone construction proved its worth. The building survived the quake and remains standing today between the **Palomar Hotel** and **the original Cooper House building**.

Local historians call it **"a survivor of the '89 quake,"** a testament to the durability of its 1906 construction and the wisdom of Patrick Neary's decision to rebuild in stone after witnessing earthquake damage to the family's earlier wooden structures.

## Historic Use and Modern Tenants

Over the years, the ground floor has housed a rotating cast of shops, galleries, and businesses — among them **Artisans Gallery**, **Twist**, **Shoe Fetish**, and the **Neary Business Center**, a fitting tribute to the building's namesake.

Today, the upper floors are occupied primarily by **professional offices**, including several **law firms** and **Redtree Partners**, a local real estate company. All list **1362 Pacific Avenue** as their address, continuing the building's role as a center of commerce more than a century after its completion.

The Patrick Neary Building remains a testament to immigrant entrepreneurship, early 20th-century craftsmanship, and the resilience of well-built architecture in earthquake country.
