## A Quiet Garden Court in Downtown Santa Cruz

Lincoln Court, built between **1905 and 1920**, is among Santa Cruz’s earliest surviving examples of **bungalow-court housing** — a design that balanced affordability, privacy, and community living. Each small cottage faces a shared landscaped courtyard, creating a peaceful residential enclave just steps from Pacific Avenue.

The complex likely served working- and middle-class residents drawn to downtown’s growing commercial core and streetcar lines. With its **low-pitched roofs, wood siding, exposed rafter tails, and paired porches**, Lincoln Court expresses the **Craftsman ideal** of simplicity and human scale rather than ornate revivalism.

## Restoration and Preservation

By the late twentieth century, Lincoln Court had become a cherished remnant of downtown’s early residential fabric. In **1990**, it was **carefully restored by Michael O’Hearn & Artisans**, whose work preserved its modest proportions, distinctive rhythm, and central courtyard. Their attention to detail — including the cleanly trimmed hedges that remain a signature of their projects — helped secure Lincoln Court’s place within the **Santa Cruz Downtown Historic District**.
