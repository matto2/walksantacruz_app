## From Dentist’s Office to Coffeehouse Hub

The building at 418 Cedar Street is historically known as the **Dr. Miller Building**. According to property records, it was constructed in **1913**. For many years, it served as the dental practice of **Dr. Miller**, whose name long remained faintly visible on the facade — a ghost sign connecting the present to its early 20th-century professional past.

In the 1970s the building entered a new chapter when **Caffe Pergolesi** opened at this address. Originally founded in 1973, the café relocated from Pacific Avenue to **Cedar and Elm** following the **1989 Loma Prieta earthquake**. The Perg became one of the city’s most beloved cultural gathering spots, known for its Victorian charm, wrap-around porch, and eclectic energy that predated chain coffeehouses and the era of Wi-Fi cafés.

## The Perg and the Sound of Santa Cruz

Inside, Caffe Pergolesi was famous for its rotating displays of provocative art and its sense of creative freedom. Outdoors, students, writers, musicians, and free spirits gathered at all hours.  
**One of the most popular bands to ever emerge from Santa Cruz, the folk-roots trio The Devil Makes Three, all worked together selling coffee at Pergolesi.** Their connection to the café became part of local lore, symbolizing the site’s influence on the city’s bohemian and musical culture.

## End of an Era

Caffe Pergolesi closed in 2017 after more than four decades in business, marking the end of a Santa Cruz institution. Today, 418 Cedar Street remains a cherished link between eras — from Dr. Miller’s early-century dental practice to a hub of counter-culture conversation, espresso, and song.
