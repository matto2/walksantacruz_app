## Overview

The building later known as the **Cooper House** was constructed **1894–1895** as **Santa Cruz County Courthouse #5** at **110 Cooper Street**. Designed by **N. A. Comstock** and built by **Thomas Beck**, it was a robust **Richardsonian Romanesque** civic landmark with heavy masonry walls, broad round-arched openings, and a commanding corner presence.

## From Courthouse to Cultural Hub

After court operations moved in **1967**, the county sold the vacant courthouse. In the **early 1970s**, local developer **Max Walden** purchased and **redeveloped** the property, reopening it in **1972** as the **Cooper House**—a lively mix of shops, offices, food, and music that became a much‑loved gathering place throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Street life and performances spilled into the surrounding plaza, a cultural precursor to today’s **Abbott Square**.

## 1989 Earthquake and Demolition

The **Loma Prieta earthquake (October 17, 1989)** severely damaged the building. Despite preservation efforts, it was **demolished** soon after the quake. In subsequent years the block was reimagined; the **MAH** and **Abbott Square** now activate the site with public art, dining, and events.

## Interesting Facts

- The courthouse/Cooper House stood at the heart of the old **Pacific Garden Mall** era of downtown.
- The name “Cooper” honors the **Cooper family**, early benefactors who helped secure land for the 19th‑century courthouse complex.
- A companion historic structure, the **Octagon Hall of Records** (1882), survived both the 1906 and 1989 quakes and remains at the corner of Front and Cooper Streets.
