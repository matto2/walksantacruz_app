## A Christmas Gift and Early Neighborhood Roots

On **December 25, 1877**, local businessman **Lewis McCormick** presented this charming home to his wife **Maggie** as an anniversary and Christmas Day gift. Recognized as one of the earliest examples of a **Victorian cottage on Walnut Avenue**, it embodies the modest elegance and craftsmanship of late-19th-century Santa Cruz architecture.

The home sits within what became **Santa Cruz’s first downtown residential neighborhood**, which began to take shape in the **1870s and 1880s** as the city’s **business district expanded along Pacific Avenue**. Local merchants, civic leaders, and tradesmen built homes here to live close to their shops and offices. The district’s historic designation confirms its role as the nucleus of early residential Santa Cruz.

## Design and Preservation

The **McCormick House** showcases features typical of the 1870s Victorian Cottage style — steep front gables, ornamental woodwork, and narrow, vertically proportioned windows. Its scale reflects a balance between urban refinement and small-town charm, characteristic of the early post-Gold Rush architecture along California’s central coast.

In later decades, **adjacent homes on this block** were **lovingly restored by Michael O’Hearn & Artisans**, a Santa Cruz-based firm known for meticulous preservation work. Their efforts helped maintain the district’s historic integrity while re-establishing its period character. The firm’s **signature cleanly trimmed hedges** and attention to detail have become visual trademarks of the neighborhood’s revival.

## Legacy

Today, the McCormick House remains a proud part of the **Downtown Historic District**, offering a glimpse of how early Santa Cruz families lived and built community near the civic core. Its story bridges the city’s formative years and its ongoing culture of historic preservation.
