## Overview

The **Del Mar Theatre**, located on **Pacific Avenue**, opened on **August 14, 1936**, as both a **vaudeville stage and movie palace**. It served as Santa Cruz’s leading entertainment venue, featuring live variety shows, musical acts, and feature films during Hollywood’s Golden Age.

Designed in the **Art Deco** style by renowned theater architect **S. Charles Lee**, the Del Mar’s illuminated tower, geometric façade, and terrazzo lobby set a new modern standard for downtown Santa Cruz. Inside, the auditorium seated over **1,500 patrons** and featured gold leaf accents, mirrored walls, and elaborate plaster ornamentation.

## Vaudeville and Early Music

In its first two decades, the Del Mar regularly hosted **vaudeville acts**, **orchestras**, and **traveling stage revues** alongside feature films. Touring performers and swing orchestras such as **Duke Ellington**, **Tommy Dorsey**, and **Harry James** brought big-band glamour to the Central Coast, with the Del Mar serving as their Santa Cruz stop.

## Rock, Jazz, and Counterculture Concerts

By the **1970s**, as downtown Santa Cruz became a hub of countercultural life, the Del Mar transformed into one of the region’s most **eclectic live music venues**.  
Confirmed performers during this era included:

- **The Tubes** — played annually through the late 1970s.
- **Jerry Garcia Band** — multiple appearances in 1976 and 1978.
- **Tom Waits** — December 1, 1977 performance.
- **Jean-Luc Ponty** — December 13, 1977 concert.
- **Journey** — November 15, 1973 show.
- **Emmylou Harris**, **Duke Ellington**, and **Lionel Hampton** also appeared during the theatre’s live-concert years.

The Del Mar’s mix of rock, jazz, and experimental acts helped keep the downtown entertainment district alive through the Pacific Garden Mall era.

## Decline and Restoration

By the late 1970s, the Del Mar was **converted into a multiplex**, losing much of its original interior. The **1989 Loma Prieta earthquake** caused significant damage, but public sentiment for preservation remained strong.

In **2002**, under the leadership of **Jim Schwenterley** and the **Nickelodeon Theatres group**, the Del Mar underwent a **major historic restoration** with support from the **City of Santa Cruz**. The renovation restored the marquee, neon tower, and 1930s color palette, while modernizing projection, sound, and seating. The project earned a **California Preservation Foundation Award** in 2003.

## Today

The Del Mar continues to operate as an **independent, art-house cinema**, screening a blend of new releases, documentaries, and classic films. Its neon tower remains a defining landmark of **downtown Santa Cruz**, symbolizing both the city’s resilience and its enduring creative spirit.
