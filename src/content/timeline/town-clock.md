If you stand under the **Town Clock**, you’re hearing a heartbeat from the early 1900s ticking inside a tower from **1976**.  
The clock once crowned the old **Independent Order of Odd Fellows (IOOF)** building on Pacific Avenue. When that building was modernized in **1964**, its clock and tower were taken down and—remarkably—**sold to the City for $1.01**. Then the parts disappeared into basement storage, a sleeping relic waiting for a new stage.

America’s **Bicentennial** woke it up. Santa Cruz rallied behind a plan: build a new brick tower on **Mission Hill’s lower shoulder** at the meeting of **Water Street and North Pacific Avenue**, and reinstall the historic mechanism. To help pay for it, neighbors and organizations bought **blue bricks**—their names still hiding in plain sight at your feet. The city placed the tower **directly over the 1967 Morris Memorial Fountain**, stitching two civic landmarks into one.

The clock was **dedicated on July 4, 1976**, a small-town celebration with big symbolism—reclaiming a beloved sound for downtown. Over time, the site gathered more layers of meaning. In the early 1990s, a plaque was added **honoring Santa Cruz lives lost in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake**. In **1995**, the nearby peace sculpture **“Collateral Damage: A Reality of War”** deepened the plaza’s role as a place to remember, reflect, and speak out.

That’s why the Town Clock matters here: it doesn’t just **tell time**—it **collects time**. Every hour rings past and present together: the fraternal hall that once towered over Pacific, the Bicentennial optimism, the grief of 1989, the everyday bustle of the farmers’ market and rallies. It’s a measure of minutes, yes—but also of **memory**.
