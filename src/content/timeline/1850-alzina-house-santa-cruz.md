## From Minorca to Mission Hill

Francisco Alzina arrived in California after a remarkable journey — born in Menorca in 1821, he voyaged to the U.S. and eventually settled in the Santa Cruz area. Soon after the mission lands were secularized he built what is believed to be the **oldest wooden‑frame home in Santa Cruz County**, right here on Sylvar Street, around **1850**.

## Life at the Oldest House

In a region that saw adobe ranchos, Victorian mansions, and lumber‑boomed cottages, Alzina’s house stands out because it was built in wood at a time when many homes were still adobe or simple plank‑style. He fashioned this residence with care, and the home still tells that story through its clapboard siding and simple, enduring form.

## Sheriff in a New Era

Not long after statehood, Francisco Alzina won election as Santa Cruz County’s **first sheriff**, stepping into the new American legal order fresh from the Mexican era. Holding the peace amid rapid change, his tenure connected the old mission era to the modern county government.

## A Quiet Survival

Over the decades, the house witnessed the transformation of Mission Hill—from a hillside spread of orchards and small homes to a denser neighborhood engulfed by urban growth. While many of its contemporaries were altered or demolished, this house survived. A historic marker now stands nearby, reminding visitors that this humble salt‑box style dwelling outlasted larger, more grandiose homes.

Every time you pause at 109 Sylvar, you’re standing before something rare: the first wood‑framed permanent house in the county, built by a man who became sheriff as California found its footing. It’s more than a building—it’s a story of survival, transition, and legacy.
