## A Passage Beneath the Hill

When the **Santa Cruz & Felton Railroad** began laying track in 1876, the city refused to allow noisy steam engines down Pacific Avenue. The solution was bold: **dig a tunnel straight through Mission Hill**, directly beneath the old Mission Santa Cruz cemetery. Crews began work that January, and by **October 2, 1876**, they had broken through the 918-foot bore. Just eight days later, the first train rolled through to the beach and wharf.

The tunnel gave Santa Cruz a vital freight lifeline, carrying redwood lumber, lime, and passengers to the sea—an artery of commerce that bypassed downtown entirely.

## Bones Beneath the Rails

The tunnel’s path under the mission cemetery led to one of Santa Cruz’s most enduring legends. Over the years, **rail workers claimed that bones occasionally fell through the tunnel ceiling**, shaken loose by passing trains. The story—part folklore, part historical rumor—still circulates today, fueled by the knowledge that the tunnel really does run beneath the old burial ground.  

As *Santa Cruz Trains* described it, bones were “known to drop to the tracks over the years in their gradual migration downward,” and *Corvid Sketcher* adds that “a bone or two would fall onto the line, leaving a macabre find for rail crews.” Whether apocryphal or true, it’s a story that has haunted Mission Hill for generations.

## The Little Depot by the Portal

In **1879**, after the South Pacific Coast Railroad took control of the line, a **small passenger depot** was built just outside the **east portal** at **Chestnut (then Cherry) Street**. This compact wooden structure served passengers using the tunnel and sat **directly across the street from the rival Santa Cruz Railroad depot**, creating a rare sight: two competing rail stations nearly facing each other.  

The little depot operated for about a decade, handling local passenger traffic and small freight shipments until the **new Union Depot opened in 1893**, consolidating rail services downtown. By the early 1900s, the building was gone, leaving only the tunnel itself to carry the city’s remaining trains.

## From Steam to Today

In **1907**, the tunnel was widened for standard-gauge trains, its portals rebuilt and squared off in concrete. It remained an essential route for freight and later for the beloved **“Beach Train”** excursions that still rumble through today.  

Standing above Mission Hill, few realize that beneath their feet runs a living piece of 19th-century engineering—**a silent passage through history, soil, and rumor**, where the past sometimes seems just a few feet below the surface.
