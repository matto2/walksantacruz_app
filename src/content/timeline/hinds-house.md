When Alfred J. Hinds and his wife Sarah moved into their new home in **1889**, they weren’t just building one of Santa Cruz’s grandest residences — they were pushing into the future. The house was designed by **John H. Williams**, a prolific local architect who left his mark on some sixty buildings in the area.

Constructed in what’s known as the **Stick‑Eastlake** style, the home blends decorative wooden trusses, turned spindles, and elegant porches with some Colonial and classical revival touches. Its interior boasts fine redwood, cedar, oak, stained glass, and carved detailing — in fact, the three fireplace hearths feature art tiles by J. & G. Low of Charleston, Massachusetts.

## A Light from the Coast

What makes Hinds House especially remarkable is its early embrace of electricity. In the **1890s**, it was among the **first houses in downtown Santa Cruz** to be fitted with electric lighting. The power came via lines from **Fred Swanton’s new power plant**, located about fifteen miles north at Davenport.

The original electric fixture was installed at the base of the grand stairway, and — amazing as it sounds — **that same fixture still works today** in the Hinds House. It stands as a bridge between eras: Victorian ornament meets modern technology.

## Trials, Transformations, and Preservation

After Hinds’ death in **1921**, the house passed through generations and periods of neglect. In **1930**, two women schoolteachers bought it and converted it to a boarding house, operating rooms for lodging until about 1960. Through the 1960s and ’70s, parts of the first-floor parlor and sitting room were remodeled into apartments.

In **1981**, Sandra and Stan Mock purchased the home and undertook a careful restoration, reviving much of the original detail and layout. Just one year later, in **1982**, the Santa Cruz Historical Society recognized it as a local historic landmark. Then, in **1983**, it was officially listed in the **National Register of Historic Places** as **NRHP #83001241**.

Today, the Hinds House operates as a guest‑house/inn, preserving much of the original woodwork, stained glass, and stairway with that historic light still glowing at the bottom.
