Patrick Neary (1842–1933) was an Irish immigrant who arrived in Santa Cruz in the **1860s** and built one of the city's most enduring commercial landmarks. His story embodies the arc of Irish immigrant entrepreneurship in 19th-century California—from newcomer to substantial landowner and developer.

## Arrival in Santa Cruz (1860s)

Neary arrived in Santa Cruz during the **1860s**, when the city was transitioning from a Mexican-era settlement to an American commercial hub fueled by the lumber industry and coastal trade. Like many Irish immigrants of his generation, he sought opportunity in California's developing towns rather than the crowded, competitive cities of the East Coast.

The Neary family appears to have established themselves relatively quickly in Santa Cruz's commercial life. A possible relative, **James Neary** (listed as "J. Nary"), appears on the **1866 Santa Cruz map** as a property owner in **"Block No. 1"** on Mission Hill in the core downtown area. The property was half of an old mission adobe, acquired from **Felipe Armas** (or his estate) in **1864**—suggesting the family had connections to both the Mexican-era landholders and the emerging American commercial economy.

## Landowner and Businessman

By the late 19th century, Patrick Neary had become a **significant local landowner**, with property holdings on **Pacific Avenue**, the city's primary commercial corridor. His family operated a **restaurant** on the avenue, serving the growing population of merchants, lumber workers, and tourists drawn to Santa Cruz's seaside location.

Neary's success reflected the broader pattern of Irish immigrant entrepreneurship in California—building wealth through real estate, commercial ventures, and patient accumulation of property in growing towns.

## The 1906 Earthquake and Rebuilding

In **1906**, the **San Francisco earthquake** struck the Bay Area with devastating force. Though Santa Cruz was 75 miles south of the epicenter, the shaking was severe enough to damage buildings throughout downtown.

The Neary family's **wooden structures on Pacific Avenue**—including their restaurant—were **knocked out of alignment and damaged** by the quake. Rather than simply repairing the damaged wood-frame buildings, Patrick Neary made a bold decision: **he would rebuild in stone**.

This choice demonstrated both financial confidence and practical foresight. Stone and masonry construction was significantly more expensive than wood, but Neary had witnessed firsthand how wooden buildings performed in earthquakes. He wanted a permanent commercial building that would stand for generations—one worthy of Pacific Avenue's status as Santa Cruz's commercial heart.

## The Patrick Neary Building (1906)

Neary commissioned **architect Edward Van Cleeck**, one of Santa Cruz's leading designers, to create a new building in the **Richardsonian Romanesque** style—a robust architectural language characterized by heavy masonry, rounded arches, and commanding street presence.

Van Cleeck designed **1362 Pacific Avenue** with:

- **Stone façade** with rusticated masonry
- **Paired arched second-story windows** separated by columns with **Corinthian capitals**
- **Iron columns** framing ground-floor storefronts for commercial flexibility
- Solid construction built to withstand future earthquakes

The building represented a significant investment and a statement of confidence in downtown Santa Cruz's commercial future. Neary's willingness to build such a substantial structure during the uncertain period following the 1906 earthquake demonstrated his belief that Santa Cruz would continue to prosper.

## Commercial Legacy

The ground floor of the Patrick Neary Building housed a succession of businesses over the decades:

- The Neary family's **restaurant operations**
- Shops, galleries, and retail businesses including **Artisans Gallery**, **Twist**, and **Shoe Fetish**
- The **Neary Business Center**, a fitting tribute to the building's namesake

The upper floors were converted into **professional offices** in the early **1980s** by owner **Redtree Properties**, becoming home to law firms, real estate companies, and other businesses that continue the building's commercial role more than a century after construction.

## Surviving the 1989 Earthquake

Patrick Neary's foresight in building with stone proved prescient **83 years later**. When the **1989 Loma Prieta earthquake** struck Santa Cruz, many downtown buildings—including the beloved Cooper House—were damaged beyond repair or demolished.

The **Patrick Neary Building survived**.

Its solid stone construction, built to standards that exceeded requirements even in 1906, allowed it to weather the 1989 quake with minimal damage. Today it stands between the **Palomar Hotel** and the **original Cooper House building**, one of the few pre-1910 commercial structures still intact on Pacific Avenue.

Local historians call it **"a survivor of the '89 quake"**—a testament to the durability of its 1906 construction and the wisdom of Patrick Neary's decision to rebuild in stone rather than wood.

## Recognition and Legacy

The **Museum of Art & History** and the city's **blue plaque program** honor the building with a historic marker mounted on the façade:

> **"1906 – Patrick Neary Building – Edward Van Cleeck, Architect – Richardsonian Romanesque."**

The building was recognized as a **contributing structure** in the former **Pacific Avenue Historic District**, celebrating its role in downtown's architectural heritage.

Patrick Neary died in **1933** at age **91**, having witnessed Santa Cruz's transformation from a frontier lumber town to a thriving seaside city. His building at 1362 Pacific Avenue remains a testament to:

- **Irish immigrant entrepreneurship** and the prosperity achievable in California's developing towns
- **Practical foresight** in choosing earthquake-resistant construction after experiencing the 1906 disaster
- **Commercial confidence** in downtown Santa Cruz's future during uncertain times
- **Architectural quality** that has allowed the building to serve successive generations for over 117 years

Today, every business that occupies the Patrick Neary Building benefits from the durability and elegance of construction choices made more than a century ago by an Irish immigrant who believed in building things to last.
