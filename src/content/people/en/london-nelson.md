London Nelson was born enslaved in North Carolina around **1800** and lived through one of the most remarkable transformations of his time—from slavery to freedom to local benefactor in early Santa Cruz. His story embodies perseverance, generosity, and a deep belief in education as the key to progress.

## From Enslavement to Freedom

Nelson spent his early years in bondage in **North Carolina** and later **Tennessee**. Around **1850**, he was taken west by his enslaver during the **Gold Rush**, along with another enslaved man named **Marlborough**, to work claims along the **American River**.

The two men eventually earned enough money from mining to **buy their freedom**. By the mid-1850s, Nelson had settled in **Santa Cruz as a free man**—a rare and courageous choice at a time when Black Californians still faced severe discrimination.

## A Quiet Life in Santa Cruz

In Santa Cruz, Nelson made his living through steady, humble work. He farmed a small plot near today's downtown, growing **onions, melons, and potatoes**, and supplemented his income as a **cobbler**. He eventually bought a small cabin and parcel of land along what was then **San Jose Road** (near present-day Water Street).

Neighbors remembered him as industrious and kind. Though he never married or had children, his sense of community ran deep. When he became ill with **tuberculosis in 1860**, he decided to leave everything he owned to support the town's public school.

In his handwritten will, Nelson stated:

> "unto Santa Cruz School District, No. One, all of my estate … forever, for the purpose of promoting the interest of education therein …"

## Gift to the Town

Nelson's estate—valued at roughly **$377**—included his land, produce, and small debts owed to him. Modest as it was, it made an outsized impact: his donation allowed **Santa Cruz's struggling school district to reopen** and later to build the **first permanent schoolhouse on Mission Hill**.

His headstone at **Evergreen Cemetery** reads:

> "He was a colored man and willed all his property to Santa Cruz School District No. 1. Rest in Peace."

A local obituary praised him as

> "a man respected by those who knew him well enough to appreciate his good sense, his honesty and fidelity to friends."

## Resting Place and Legacy

London Nelson was buried at **Evergreen Cemetery** in Santa Cruz. His grave lies near a section that includes other African American residents from the same era—people whose lives, like his, helped shape the early community. That proximity is often noted as another quiet reflection of his generosity and belonging within Santa Cruz's early Black population.

Over time, the spelling of his first name ("London" or "Louden") varied in records, but his influence never faded. His name is honored today by the **Louden Nelson Community Center**, and his story continues to symbolize civic kindness and the power of education as a legacy that outlives wealth.

Nelson's gift represents one of the earliest documented acts of African American philanthropy for public education in California—a testament to his belief that freedom and education were inseparable, and that investing in children was the truest form of community building.
