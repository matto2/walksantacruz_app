Fred Wilder Swanton was born in **Brooklyn, New York** on **April 11, 1862**, the son of Albion Paris Kingston Swanton and Emily Jane Parshley of Maine. His father had moved to California earlier, and in **1866**, young Fred and his mother joined him. The following year, in **1867**, the family settled permanently in **Santa Cruz**—where Fred would spend the rest of his life reshaping the city's destiny.

## Early Ambition and Entrepreneurial Vision

Swanton grew up during Santa Cruz's transition from a frontier lumber town to a coastal community. He developed an eye for opportunity and infrastructure—understanding that the key to prosperity lay not just in commerce, but in the systems that made modern life possible: electricity, transportation, and recreation.

## Big Creek Power Company – Bringing Light to the Coast

In the mid-**1890s**, Swanton purchased a large tract of land along **Scott and Big Creeks** north of Davenport. There, he envisioned something revolutionary: a hydroelectric power plant that could bring electricity to Santa Cruz and beyond.

In **1896**, he founded the **Big Creek Power Company** and served as secretary and general manager. The plant began operations in **March 1896** as **California's third hydroelectric power plant**—and remarkably, the entire system was installed in just **60 days**.

**Eighteen miles of electrical lines** were extended from Big Creek atop **Ben Lomond Mountain** down to Santa Cruz, delivering reliable electric power to homes and businesses for the first time. The **Hinds House** at 529 Chestnut Street was among the first downtown residences to receive electric lighting from Swanton's lines, and its original electric fixture still works today.

Over the next five years, the Big Creek power plant expanded its reach to **Capitola and Watsonville**, becoming **California's first long-distance electric power system**. The plant operated from **1896 to 1948**, when a forest fire destroyed the wooden flume and the facility was abandoned.

## Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk

Swanton's most visible legacy is the **Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk**, which he founded and developed as a seaside amusement destination. His vision transformed the waterfront into a premier tourist attraction that drew visitors from across California and helped establish Santa Cruz's identity as a beach resort city.

The Boardwalk became one of California's iconic landmarks, and it remains in operation today as one of the few surviving seaside amusement parks on the West Coast.

## Electric Streetcar Line

Swanton didn't stop with electricity and entertainment. He also promoted and financed Santa Cruz's **first electric streetcar line**, connecting neighborhoods and enabling the city's outward expansion. The streetcars made it possible for residents to live farther from downtown while still accessing work, shopping, and services.

## Mayor of Santa Cruz

Swanton served three terms as **Mayor of Santa Cruz** from **1927 to 1933**, guiding the city through the challenging years of the Great Depression. His leadership combined practical governance with a continued commitment to infrastructure and civic improvement.

## Village of Swanton

The small coastal village of **Swanton**, located north of Davenport along Highway 1, was named in his honor—a lasting geographic reminder of his influence on the North Coast region where his power plant once operated.

## Legacy

Fred Wilder Swanton died in **1940** in Santa Cruz, leaving behind a transformed city. His contributions spanned:

- **Electricity infrastructure**: The Big Creek Power Company brought modern electric power to Santa Cruz County for the first time
- **Public transportation**: His streetcar line enabled urban expansion and connectivity
- **Tourism and recreation**: The Beach Boardwalk became an economic engine and cultural icon
- **Civic leadership**: Three terms as mayor during critical years of growth and challenge

Swanton's vision extended beyond individual projects—he understood that infrastructure, recreation, and civic pride were interconnected. By bringing electricity, transportation, and entertainment to Santa Cruz, he helped transform a remote lumber town into a modern seaside city that could compete with larger California communities.

His name lives on in the coastal village of Swanton and in the enduring institutions he created, particularly the Beach Boardwalk, which continues to draw millions of visitors more than a century after he first envisioned it.
