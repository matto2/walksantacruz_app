Salvator and Frances Bagnell Fachutar were passionate musicians who transformed Santa Cruz's cultural landscape by building and operating what became known as **"the largest music house between San Francisco and Los Angeles"** in the early 20th century.

## Building the Fachutar House (1921)

In **1921**, the Fachutars commissioned architect **Allen Collins** to design **303 Walnut Avenue**—a unique building that served as both their family home and a professional music studio and concert hall.

The Craftsman/Spanish Revival blend structure was specifically designed to support their musical ambitions, with spaces for:
- **Music instruction** (piano and voice lessons)
- **Concert performances** and recitals
- **Living quarters** for the family
- **Perfume production facilities**

The building's design reflected their innovative approach to combining artistic passion with practical income generation.

## The Largest Music House Between Two Cities

The Fachutars' music house quickly gained regional recognition. Students traveled from across the Central Coast to study with them, and their concert series brought classical music to Santa Cruz audiences during an era when cultural programming was limited in smaller California cities.

The property became a hub where:
- Aspiring musicians received professional instruction
- Touring and local performers gave recitals and concerts
- The community gathered to experience live classical music
- The sounds of piano and voice lessons drifted through the Walnut Avenue neighborhood

Their operation filled an important gap in Santa Cruz's cultural ecosystem—providing both education and performance venues for serious music at a time when the city was still developing its artistic infrastructure.

## Perfume Production – Supporting Art Through Enterprise

To sustain their musical pursuits financially, the Fachutars also **manufactured perfume on the property**—an unusual but creative means of supporting their artistic ambitions.

This entrepreneurial approach allowed them to maintain financial independence while dedicating themselves primarily to music. The scent of their perfume enterprise literally mingled with the sounds of music lessons drifting through downtown Santa Cruz, creating a multisensory cultural landmark.

Their model demonstrated how artists could combine creative passion with practical business to build sustainable cultural institutions.

## Sale to the YWCA (1944)

In **1944**, Frances Fachutar sold 303 Walnut Avenue to the **Santa Cruz YWCA**, marking a transition from private music house to community service organization.

The YWCA, under the leadership of **Mrs. Fred McPherson**, **Edith Hinds**, **Mabel Byrne**, and **Bertha Adams**, transformed the building into a pioneering organization dedicated to:
- **Women's empowerment**
- **Racial inclusion**
- **Youth programming**

The building became affectionately known as **"Club 303"** and hosted:
- One of Santa Cruz's first **teen nightclubs**
- The **Gay Troubadours**, the first all-boys club sponsored by a YWCA
- Programs that broke social barriers and provided safe, welcoming spaces for young people and women of all backgrounds

Frances Fachutar's decision to sell to the YWCA ensured that the building would continue serving the community's cultural and social needs—a fitting continuation of the Fachutars' original vision.

## Legacy

The Fachutar House stands today as the **Walnut Avenue Family & Women's Center**, continuing to provide support, education, and advocacy for women and families across Santa Cruz County.

Nearly a century after Salvator and Frances Fachutar built it, the building's walls still resonate with purpose:
- From **music instruction to women's empowerment**
- From **concert performances to youth programming**
- From **private artistic vision to community service**

The Fachutars demonstrated how cultural entrepreneurs could shape a community's character by creating institutions that outlast their founders. Their music house was not just a business—it was a statement about the importance of art, education, and community gathering spaces.

## Cultural Impact

The Fachutars' influence extended beyond their years of operation:

1. **Cultural Infrastructure**: They built one of the Central Coast's major music venues during a period when such facilities were rare
2. **Educational Legacy**: Hundreds of students received music instruction at their studio
3. **Community Foundation**: Their building became the YWCA, which served thousands of women and youth
4. **Entrepreneurial Model**: They showed how artists could combine creative passion with business to build sustainable institutions

Today, visitors to the **Walnut Avenue Family & Women's Center** can see the **Fachutar House Historical Marker** commemorating the building's origins as a music house and concert hall—a reminder that the arts and social services share common roots in community building and human connection.

The Fachutars' story illustrates how individual passion and entrepreneurial creativity can create institutions that serve communities across generations, adapting to changing needs while maintaining their fundamental purpose of enriching lives.
