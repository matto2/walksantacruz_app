## Early Life and Journey West

Born **November 30, 1818**, in **Greenfield, Saratoga County, New York**, Elihu Anthony was raised in a **Quaker family**. As a young man, he became a **Methodist minister** and married **Sarah A. Van Anda** in 1845 in **Fort Wayne, Indiana**.

In **1847**, Anthony and his family joined the westward migration, setting out on the **Oregon Trail**. They diverted to California, taking the treacherous **Donner Pass route** and arriving in the **Santa Cruz area** around **December 1847 to January 1848**—just as the Gold Rush was about to transform California.

## Establishing Santa Cruz's First Commercial Center

Anthony quickly became a central figure in Santa Cruz's early development. He purchased an **18-acre parcel downtown** and built what became the **first commercial block in Santa Cruz**, known as the **Anthony Block**. This included:

- A **blacksmith shop**
- The **Santa Cruz Foundry**
- A sawmill
- A general store

During the **Gold Rush era**, Anthony's ironworks proved invaluable. He profited by manufacturing **pick-axes and mining tools**—iron work was rare and desperately needed in early California. His foundry also made history by producing **California's first cast-iron plows** in **1848**. Using patterns brought from the East, the foundry cast iron plow blades and fitted them to wooden frames locally—a crucial agricultural innovation for the developing state.

## Building Infrastructure

Anthony's entrepreneurial vision extended beyond his foundry:

### Maritime Commerce

With **Henry Cowell**, Anthony helped build Santa Cruz's **first wharf** (the **Cowell Wharf**), creating vital infrastructure for shipping lumber and lime—linking his efforts to the early economic life of the city.

### Water Works

In **1865**, Anthony partnered with **Frederic A. Hihn** to create the **first private water-supply network** in Santa Cruz and nearby communities, helping modernize the region's infrastructure.

## Political Career and Progressive Advocacy

Anthony served as a member of the **California State Assembly** representing the **6th District** from **January 5, 1880 to January 3, 1881**.

As a committed **abolitionist**, he supported the **Union during the Civil War** and worked to ensure **integrated schools in Santa Cruz**—an important progressive stand for his era.

He also continued his religious calling, serving as a preacher alongside his business ventures.

## A Complex Legacy

Anthony's legacy reflects the contradictions of his time. While progressive on racial integration and education, he was also part of the **anti-Chinese movement** that swept California in the 1870s.

He led the **"Non-Partisan Anti-Chinese Association"** and was active in the **Workingmen's Party of California**, which advocated for Chinese exclusion. This aspect of his life represents the exclusionary currents that coexisted with progressive movements in 19th-century California.

## Death and Remembrance

Elihu Anthony died **August 15, 1905**, at age **86** in Santa Cruz. He is buried at **Santa Cruz Memorial Park**.

Despite the complexities of his political positions, Anthony is widely regarded as **one of the founding fathers of Santa Cruz**, thanks to his early investments, industrial enterprises, infrastructure development, and civic leadership that helped transform a mission outpost into a thriving commercial city.

His foundry site at the **Lower Plaza** (Front Street and Pacific Avenue) became the birthplace of downtown Santa Cruz commerce—a legacy that endures in the city's historic core.
