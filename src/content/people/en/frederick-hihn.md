Frederick Augustus Hihn was one of the most ambitious and influential figures in the early development of Santa Cruz County. Born in **1829** in **Altendorf, Duchy of Brunswick** (now Germany), he immigrated to California during the **Gold Rush of 1849**. Like many, he came seeking gold, but quickly realized that lasting opportunity lay in enterprise, not the mines.

By **1851**, Hihn was traveling south with a wagon of goods bound for Monterey Bay. He didn't plan to stay in Santa Cruz—but fate, and a borrowed mule, had other ideas.

## The Yellow Mule

Hihn later wrote down the story of his arrival in Santa Cruz in a memoir titled **"How I Came to Santa Cruz."**

> "The first man I met was Andrew Trust. I asked him about team and a place, but he looked at the yellow mule and did not pay any attention to what I said."

That mule—light-colored and easy to recognize—had already been through some adventures. Hihn had bought it in San Jose without knowing its history. When he reached Santa Cruz and stopped for supper, a commotion began outside.

> "While we were eating our supper … I heard a good many people … 'Where did you get that yellow mule from?' … 'That is my mule,' said Captain Whiting, 'he was stolen from me in this town about that long ago.' … 'Everybody knows my mule.' … 'Yes,' they all said laughing. So I had to give up the yellow mule."

Instead of bitterness, Hihn ended the story with good humor:

> "Many times I had refused to sell or swap him off … but it was all right anyhow, he must have inspired me to bring him home."

And so, by a twist of luck and a misidentified mule, Frederick A. Hihn arrived in Santa Cruz—where he would spend the rest of his life building an empire.

## Builder and Entrepreneur

Once settled, Hihn's energy and vision reshaped Santa Cruz.

**Early Industry:** He opened a general store, became a lumber dealer, and bought vast redwood tracts for timber production. His sawmills operated in the mountains near Soquel, Aptos, Laurel, and Glenwood.

**Land Holdings:** By the late 1800s, Hihn controlled roughly **5 percent of all land in Santa Cruz County**. His holdings included much of the former **Rancho Soquel Augmentation**—coastal flats, redwood forests, and prime farmland.

**Infrastructure:** In **1865**, Hihn partnered with **Elihu Anthony** to establish the **first private water system in Santa Cruz**, piping water from the San Lorenzo River to the growing town.

**Transportation:** He was a founder and later president of the **Santa Cruz & Watsonville Railroad Company**, incorporated in **1873**, which connected local lumber and agricultural industries to regional trade routes.

**Architecture:** In **1872** he built his landmark **Italianate-style mansion on Church Street**, a symbol of his prosperity and influence in Santa Cruz society.

## Camp Capitola and the Coast

Along the coast east of Santa Cruz, Hihn developed seaside land that would later become the **city of Capitola**. In **1869** he leased a portion of his Soquel property to **Samuel A. Hall**, who opened **Camp Capitola in 1874**—one of California's earliest planned seaside resorts.

Families traveled by wagon and rail to spend summers under canvas tents beside the beach, with organized entertainment and fresh sea air. After Hall's lease expired, Hihn subdivided the property and began selling lots in **1882**, laying the foundation for a permanent village. That community later became the incorporated **City of Capitola**.

The historic **Hihn Building on Monterey Avenue** still stands as a remnant of the original resort operations, once serving as headquarters for his coastal business ventures.

## Civic and Political Life

Hihn served a term in the **California State Assembly**, representing Santa Cruz County. He was a driving force in the city's modernization—an advocate for roads, schools, and public services. Despite occasional controversy for his aggressive business practices, his efforts left an enduring mark on local infrastructure and development.

## Legacy

By the time of his death in **1913**, Frederick A. Hihn had helped transform Santa Cruz from a remote lumber settlement into a connected and thriving seaside community. His ventures in timber, real estate, water, and transportation laid the foundations for modern Santa Cruz and Capitola.

And it all began, fittingly, with a yellow mule and a reluctant detour that became a lifelong home.
