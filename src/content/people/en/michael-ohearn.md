Michael O'Hearn (1940–2011) was a retired Silicon Valley architect who found his true calling in historic preservation, dedicating the latter part of his career to restoring and protecting Santa Cruz's architectural heritage. Through his firm **"Michael O'Hearn & Artisans,"** he meticulously restored over **30 historic homes and landscapes** in Santa Cruz, helping to establish the city's reputation for thoughtful preservation and adaptive reuse.

## Early Career in Silicon Valley

O'Hearn spent his early career as an architect in **Silicon Valley**, designing hundreds of commercial buildings throughout California. His work contributed to the rapid development of the technology corridor during its formative decades, giving him deep experience in construction, materials, and architectural systems.

## Pivot to Historic Preservation

After retiring from commercial architecture, O'Hearn turned his attention to historic preservation in Santa Cruz. Rather than demolishing or dramatically altering older structures, he saw value in carefully restoring them to honor their original design while making them functional for contemporary use.

His preservation philosophy combined architectural accuracy with practical livability—respecting historical details while ensuring buildings could serve modern residents and businesses.

## Lincoln Court Restoration (1990)

O'Hearn's most celebrated restoration project was **Lincoln Court** (315-323 Lincoln Street), a complex of **bungalow-court housing** built between **1905 and 1920**.

In **1990**, O'Hearn and his team undertook a comprehensive restoration that preserved Lincoln Court's:

- **Modest Craftsman proportions** and distinctive rhythm
- **Central landscaped courtyard** that created a peaceful residential enclave
- **Low-pitched roofs, wood siding, exposed rafter tails, and paired porches**
- Original character as one of Santa Cruz's earliest surviving examples of bungalow-court housing

His restoration work included meticulous attention to landscaping, featuring **cleanly trimmed hedges** that became a signature aesthetic of his projects. These hedges created "gentle barriers" and defined spaces while respecting the original architectural vision.

The restoration helped secure Lincoln Court's place within the **Santa Cruz Downtown Historic District** and demonstrated that affordable housing could be preserved and celebrated as part of the city's architectural heritage.

A **1997 Santa Cruz Sentinel article** titled "Gentle barriers: 'Narrowscapes' define architect's vision" highlighted O'Hearn's thoughtful approach to landscape design at Lincoln Court, emphasizing how his work balanced privacy, community, and historic character.

## Other Major Restorations

Beyond Lincoln Court, O'Hearn restored over **30 additional historic properties** in Santa Cruz, including:

**McCornick House** (241 Walnut Avenue): The 1877 Victorian residence of early Santa Cruz physician and County Supervisor Daniel McCornick. O'Hearn's restoration preserved the home's original details while ensuring its continued use.

**Progressive Missionary Baptist Church**: O'Hearn applied his preservation expertise to religious architecture, ensuring this community landmark remained functional and historically accurate.

His portfolio of restored homes spans Santa Cruz's downtown neighborhoods, particularly along **Walnut Avenue, Chestnut Street, and Lincoln Street**, where his signature landscaping and attention to architectural detail created a cohesive aesthetic that helped define the area's character.

## Signature Aesthetic

O'Hearn developed a recognizable preservation style characterized by:

- **Meticulous attention to original architectural details**: Preserving trim work, windows, porches, and materials
- **Cleanly trimmed hedges and thoughtful landscaping**: Creating privacy and definition while respecting historic sightlines
- **"Narrowscapes"**: His term for using landscaping to create gentle barriers and intimate spaces without walls or fences
- **Functional preservation**: Making historic buildings livable for contemporary use without compromising their integrity

His work demonstrated that historic preservation could be both beautiful and practical—honoring the past while serving the present.

## Legacy and Death

Michael O'Hearn died on **August 2, 2011** at age **71** in Santa Cruz. His legacy lives on in the **30+ restored properties** scattered throughout downtown Santa Cruz, each bearing the marks of his careful craftsmanship and respect for architectural history.

His work helped establish Santa Cruz's identity as a city that values its architectural past. The **Downtown Historic District**, which includes many of his restoration projects, stands as a testament to his vision that old buildings deserve preservation, not demolition.

O'Hearn's influence extended beyond individual buildings:

- He demonstrated that historic preservation could be economically viable
- His projects showed that modest working-class housing (like bungalow courts) deserved the same preservation attention as grand mansions
- His signature landscaping aesthetic became a model for how to balance privacy and community in dense historic neighborhoods

For visitors walking through downtown Santa Cruz today, O'Hearn's impact is visible in the Lincoln Court bungalows, the McCornick House, and dozens of other lovingly preserved properties—each one a reminder that architecture is not just about building new, but also about honoring and protecting what came before.
