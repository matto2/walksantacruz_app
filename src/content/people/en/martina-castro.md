María Martina Castro y Amador was born in **1807** in **Villa de Branciforte**, which is now part of Santa Cruz. She became one of the most prominent **Californio women** of the Mexican era, receiving one of the largest land grants in what would become Santa Cruz County.

## Family and Mission Connections

Martina was the daughter of **José Joaquín Castro** (1768–1838), a soldier with the **Anza Expedition of 1775–76** that helped establish the early Spanish settlements in California. After military service at the presidios of San Francisco and Monterey, he settled near Santa Cruz and became the **mayordomo (overseer) of Mission Santa Cruz**, managing livestock, crops, and laborers.

The Castro family's deep ties to both the mission and the nearby settlement of Branciforte helped position Martina for success in the next generation, when Mexican authorities began granting mission and government lands to private citizens.

## Rancho Soquel and the Augmentation Grant

In **1833**, Governor **José Figueroa** granted Martina the **Rancho Soquel**, a tract of about **1,668 acres** east of Santa Cruz. A decade later, in **1844**, she secured an additional **32,000 acres** known as the **Rancho Soquel Augmentation**—a vast area of redwood forest and hills stretching inland from the coast.

From her land-grant petition, Martina wrote:

> "I, María Martina Castro y Amador, by and with the consent of my husband Michael Lodge, petition that the tract of land adjoining the rancho now held may be granted me for the cattle and timber advantages thereof."

This statement, preserved in her official claim, shows her **active role in pursuing and managing the grant**—an uncommon level of independence for a woman of her era.

## Marriages and Enterprise

Martina's life intertwined family, hardship, and determined land management:

**1824 – First marriage:** to **Simón Cota**, a soldier from Monterey. They had four children before his death in 1830.

**1831 – Second marriage:** to **Michael Lodge**, an Irish immigrant who became a Mexican citizen. Together they developed timber and cattle operations on the Soquel lands and pursued the augmentation grant.

**1849 – Third marriage:** to **Louis Depeaux**, 16 years her junior; the union was short-lived.

Despite personal upheavals, Martina remained the recognized landholder and administrator of her rancho properties.

## Challenges and Later Years

After the U.S. annexation of California, the **Land Act of 1851** required all Mexican landholders to prove their titles before the U.S. Land Commission. Legal costs, translation issues, and new taxes placed enormous pressure on Californio families.

In **1850**, Martina divided Rancho Soquel into **nine equal shares**—keeping one for herself and giving the rest to her children. By the mid-1850s she had sold most of her remaining land, though she continued to live comfortably near Soquel surrounded by family until her death in **1890**.

## Legacy

Martina Castro's lands became the foundation of **Soquel, Capitola, and portions of Aptos** and the surrounding hills. Her story bridges the **Mission Santa Cruz era**, through her father's service, with the **Mexican ranch period**, when she emerged as one of the few women to independently petition for and manage large estates.

Her success—and eventual loss of land under American rule—mirrors the broader story of Californio families in 19th-century Santa Cruz, caught between two worlds yet indelibly shaping both.

The **Castro Adobe** still stands today in Watsonville as a reminder of the Castro family's influence, and Martina's legacy lives on in the communities that grew from her vast land holdings along the coast and hills east of Santa Cruz.
