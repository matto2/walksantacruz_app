Edward Van Cleeck was a North Carolina-born architect who became one of Santa Cruz's most influential designers of civic and commercial architecture in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Known affectionately as the **"Merchant of Towers"** for his love of towers, turrets, and cupolas, Van Cleeck helped shape downtown Santa Cruz's distinctive architectural character.

## Arrival in Santa Cruz

Van Cleeck arrived in Santa Cruz in **1885** when he was hired by a local architectural firm. The city was experiencing growth and prosperity from the lumber industry and increasing tourism, creating demand for skilled architects who could design buildings that announced Santa Cruz's ambitions and sophistication.

In **1889**, Van Cleeck established his own architectural practice in Santa Cruz, quickly becoming the go-to designer for prominent civic and commercial projects.

## Architectural Style and Influences

Van Cleeck specialized in three complementary styles:

**Richardsonian Romanesque**: Inspired by New Orleans architect **Henry Hobson Richardson** (after whom the style was named), Van Cleeck embraced this robust architectural language characterized by heavy masonry, rounded arches, rusticated stone, and commanding street presence.

**Queen Anne Style**: The exuberant Victorian style featuring asymmetrical facades, decorative woodwork, and varied textures and colors.

**Shingle Style**: A distinctly American architectural style that used wood shingles as continuous wall surfaces, often combined with elements of Colonial Revival.

His signature touch—towers, turrets, and cupolas—appeared across all his designs, earning him the nickname **"Merchant of Towers."** These vertical elements gave his buildings distinctive profiles on Santa Cruz's skyline.

## Major Works

### Cooper Street Courthouse (1895)

Van Cleeck served as **construction supervisor** for the **1895 Cooper Street Courthouse**, which became Santa Cruz's **Richardsonian Romanesque masterpiece**. The substantial civic building featured the heavy masonry walls, broad round-arched openings, and commanding corner presence that defined the style.

The courthouse later became the **Cooper House** after county operations moved in 1967, operating as a beloved cultural hub until it was severely damaged in the **1989 Loma Prieta earthquake** and subsequently demolished. The site is now **Abbott Square Market and the Museum of Art & History (MAH)**.

### Patrick Neary Building (1906)

Van Cleeck designed the **Patrick Neary Building** at **1362 Pacific Avenue** in **1906** in the Richardsonian Romanesque style. Commissioned by **Patrick Neary** to replace wooden family buildings damaged in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, the building features:

- Heavy stone façade with **rusticated masonry**
- **Paired arched second-story windows** separated by columns with **Corinthian capitals**
- **Iron columns** framing ground-floor storefronts for commercial flexibility
- Solid construction that allowed it to survive the **1989 earthquake**

The building remains standing today between the Palomar Hotel and the original Cooper House building. The **Museum of Art & History's blue plaque program** honors it with a marker reading:

> **"1906 – Patrick Neary Building – Edward Van Cleeck, Architect – Richardsonian Romanesque."**

## Office at 176 Pacific Avenue

Van Cleeck's architectural office at **176 Pacific Avenue** became a hub of civic activity. When **Fred Swanton** launched his **"New Santa Cruz Movement"** to promote the city's development and modernization, he headquartered the initiative in Van Cleeck's downtown offices—a testament to the architect's central role in shaping the city's future.

## Legacy

Edward Van Cleeck's work during Santa Cruz's late Victorian and early 20th-century building boom left an enduring mark on the city's architectural identity. His Richardsonian Romanesque buildings on Pacific Avenue—solid, substantial, and commanding—gave downtown Santa Cruz a visual language of permanence and prosperity that distinguished it from more temporary timber construction.

His role as both designer and construction supervisor on major civic projects like the Cooper Street Courthouse demonstrated his comprehensive understanding of architecture—not just as drawing but as built reality.

Though some of his buildings, including the beloved Cooper House, have been lost to earthquakes, several survive as reminders of an era when civic buildings were designed to announce a community's aspirations through architecture. The Patrick Neary Building stands as his most visible surviving work, its rounded arches and stone façade still commanding attention on Pacific Avenue more than a century after its construction.

Van Cleeck belongs to the generation of architects who transformed Santa Cruz from a lumber town into a proper city—one with substantial civic buildings, elegant commercial blocks, and a cohesive architectural character. His nickname, "Merchant of Towers," perfectly captures his contribution: he sold Santa Cruz a vision of itself as a place worthy of towers, turrets, and monumental architecture—and then he built that vision into reality.
